# Facial-Expression-Recognition-Using-Deep-Convolutional-Neural-Network
A deep-learning-based scheme is proposed for identifying the facial expressions of different people of different ages, colours, and genders and collecting them as a dataset. The proposed  method consists of two parts. The first part extracts local features from face images by  employing a local gravitational descriptor, while in the second part, the output from the  descriptor is fed into a Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) model. Then the dataset that is used to train is fed into the Alexnet algorithm (used to train the dataset) and the  test images are compared with trained images and provide results using the Score-level fusion  technique.
